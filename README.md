# Genre Capture

*Couldn't think of a good name for this*

The real basic idea behind this is to go feed in a list of big list of files and then it'll go to IMDB can get the genre for each movie 

There's two ways to give it the list of movies (hardcoded at the moment), either change the code to tell it to read a text file with a list of films in or you can alter the code and it'll go off to Netflix and get a list of movies from there

Theres some code to go through and make folders for each genre and create a file or shortcut to that film but that's not been fleshed out yet

### Notes

This is very much a work in progress while I play around with file manipulation and web scraping
